# What is this?

This was a project that I did in Tyler McGinnis's Redux course. I diverged from the class a little bit and made my components hooks, because they look prettier :) (and work better imo)

# What I learned?

Tyler does a great job explaining Redux in this course. So I got a solid foundation of Redux from the early parts of the tutorial. Once it was time to make a React App out of it, I was able to navigate the React Redux documentation and find out how to use hooks!

# Note

The course involves using an API that purposely randomly returns errors.
